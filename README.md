## What is this repository about?

Are you having **eye strain** or **difficulty reading** your code after a few hours of work? Well many programmers never think to switch their font until they start getting headaches.

If you often find your eyes **blurring** over trying to scan a thousand lines of code or your head hurting hours after you’ve stopped coding, it may be time to try a new font. Even if you’re not getting these symptoms, a well-designed font often offers superior readability over the default system fonts.

## Why Switch Your Programming Font?

IDEs and developer tools don’t always come with the best font. They usually use a monospaced system font, while it may work fine for some, others report eye **strain** or poor readability.

 A good font can minimize headaches, make your code easier to scan, and even **revolutionize** how you work.

Fira Code is based on a special programming ligature by **Fira Mono** typeface from Mozilla, It is a great choice for those who particularly like to use a combination of letters such as “æ” including diphthongs.

Fira Code is supported by most browsers, and you can see how it looks in the real-world code examples.

With Fira code, you get the **best** and **improved ability** to scan through your code accompanied by ligatures for **arrow functions**, **equality**, and alot more.

**Adobe** has published several open-source fonts in their Source Sans family, and this one is monospaced and made explicitly, Though the regular weight will work for most programming applications, a range of weights is available if you need them.

While this font is pretty similar to the **Source Sans**, it had a few changes to better suit coders: optimized symbols, dotted zero, modified **“i,” “j,”, “l”** and alot more.

## [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)

Cascadia Code is the default font for the **Windows Terminal** and **Visual Studio** and coincidentally is the font I use in vscode, It includes a default, **mono, 
italic, and cursive font**, and it also has extra support for embedding Powerline symbols.

it’s open-source too, so you can try it out yourself.

## [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

If you use a JetBrains IDE, you may be familiar with this font. It’s made specifically for developers and optimized for reading large volumes of code, sounds very good right?

Well, JetBrains Mono comes packed with nearly **140** code ligatures, **8** weights each with italics, and support for **145** languages, The best part is that it’s also open-source and available for use in any ***personal*** or ***commercial situation***.
