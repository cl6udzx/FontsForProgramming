## What is this repository about?

Are you having **eye strain** or **difficulty reading** your code after a few hours of work? Well many programmers never think to switch their font until they start getting headaches.

If you often find your eyes **blurring** over trying to scan a thousand lines of code or your head hurting hours after you’ve stopped coding, it may be time to try a new font. Even if you’re not getting these symptoms, a well-designed font often offers superior readability over the default system fonts.

## Why Switch Your Programming Font?

IDEs and developer tools don’t always come with the best font. They usually use a monospaced system font, while it may work fine for some, others report eye **strain** or poor readability.

 A good font can minimize headaches, make your code easier to scan, and even **revolutionize** how you work.

[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is based on a special programming ligature by **Fira Mono** typeface from Mozilla, It is a great choice for those who particularly like to use a combination of letters such as “æ” including diphthongs.

Fira Code is supported by most browsers, and you can see how it looks in the real-world code examples.

With Fira code, you get the **best** and **improved ability** to scan through your code accompanied by ligatures for **arrow functions**, **equality**, and alot more.
